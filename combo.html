		<h4>About CatCombos</h4>
		<div class="block">
			<p><span class="fw orange">★ What is a CatCombo?</span><br />
			<span class="fw pink">Visit the Equip Screen, then arrange the right combination of Cat Units in the first (top) row of your battle formation</span> to unlock special trait and ability bonuses for your Cat Army.<br />
			At the beginning of each battle, your CatCombo bonuses will be revealed and applied to your units and/or Cat Base for the duration of the fight. <br />
            With the right CatCombo, your bonus might include Unit Attack Up, Unit Defense Up, Cannon Charge Speed Up, or Cat Base HP Up, or one of many other possible powerups!<br>
            Any CatCombo you discover will <span class="fw blue">be applied to all units when used - use them wisely to max out the power of your army for critical battles!</span><br><br>

            *Only Cat Units placed in the first battle row will be counted when forming CatCombos. Be aware that units placed in the second row will not be able to create any CatCombos!<br />
            *CatCombos do not require units to be placed in the same order as in the Combo Book. Any Cat in the first row can form a Combo as long as all other units required for that Combo are present in the first row as well!<br />
            *You may unlock further CatCombos and skill boosts as you advance through the Story Mode chapters and meet certain other conditions!
